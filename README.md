# Lead-Lag-Estimation
Improving the Hoffman-Rosenbaum-Yoshida Lead Lag Estimator on a toy model, and then more realistic simulated data.

This contains three files. Two Juptyer notebooks, the first containing the bulk of the estimation work, and one where we do an integral approximation to estimate the accuracy of the original estimator in the toy model, and a proposed improvement to the original. As this is very much proof of concept, the code in the Juptyer notebooks is very rough and ready, with rapid prototyping, and so is not very performant.

The final file is a write up of the work completed, including graphs and demonstrations of the improvement over the original estimator on some simulated data.
